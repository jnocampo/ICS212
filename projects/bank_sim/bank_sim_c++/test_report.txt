ICS 212 Project 2 Test Report ;

Requirements not met/not functional :

The only requirement not met was getting my getAddress() function to not fully work. On the first run of the program,
cin.getline() collects random characters from the stdio. I suspect I would need to flush the stdio at specific points
in order to correctly collect user input for the addresses! Other than that I have met all functionaility design wise.

Additional features/extra credit :

I have added no additional features to my project 2.

Future enhancements and/or general comments :

In the future, I would like to make the UI a lot more intuitive and cleaner. I believe clean UIs are one of the biggest
benefits a program can have. I would also like function that can check the user input on account numbers and automatically
tell the user if the account number is taken. Another featue I would like to implement is sorting. After every record addition,
I would like the list to sort itself because when printing all records back, it would look better to the user. It is also faster
to add new records because the list would be in sorted order.
